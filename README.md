# Student Performance Tracker

Student Performance Tracker is a full-stack web application developed to monitor, analyze, and predict student academic performance using machine learning techniques. The system integrates data analysis, predictive modeling, and web technologies to deliver actionable academic insights.

## Project Description
This application analyzes student academic data such as marks, attendance, and study hours to identify performance trends and predict outcomes. It combines a responsive frontend with scalable backend services and machine learning models to support data-driven decision making in education.

## Key Features
- Academic performance monitoring and analysis  
- Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Student performance prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- REST API based backend integration  
- Responsive user interface  
- Cloud-ready deployment architecture  

## System Architecture
Frontend is developed using React.js for a responsive and interactive user experience. Backend services are implemented using Node.js for application logic and Flask for serving machine learning models. MongoDB is used for data storage and management.

## Machine Learning Implementation
- Model Used: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Accuracy Achieved: Approximately 80%  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Processes: Data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and prediction  

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Backend: Node.js, Flask  
Database: MongoDB  
Machine Learning: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman  

## Use Case
The system helps educational institutions identify students at academic risk, analyze influencing factors, and make informed academic planning decisions using predictive analytics.

## Key Learnings
- Full-stack web application development  
- REST API design and integration  
- End-to-end machine learning workflow  
- Data analysis and visualization  
- Scalable and modular system design
